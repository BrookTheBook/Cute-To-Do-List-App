# Cute To Do List App

### Inspiration
I created this project for the Local Hack Day: Build challenge for day 4. I started this project on Repl.it a while ago, but just finished it for this competition.

### How I built it
I built it using Node.js. I found a template for creating a Node.js Application on Repl.it at first and then added on to create the To Do list Application.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
I'm proud that I managed to learn Node.js. It's a programming language that I'm not that familiar with.

### What we learned
I learned how to create a To Do List Application using Node.js. I also learned how to do some programming using Node.js.
